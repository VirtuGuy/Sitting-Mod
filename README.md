# VirtuGuy's Sitting Mod
Sometimes, in the world of Minecraft, you might want to sit down and relax. You could do this with furniture mods, but furniture mods are overrated. Imagine if you could sit anywhere...

With this mod, you have the ability to sit anywhere! To sit, the default keybind is Z, and you must be on the ground (which makes sense because how could you sit while in the air?). If you're sitting and you manage to get off the ground, your player will stop sitting.
